Data Scraping on Weatherbit by API

In this repository, there are two python scripts to collect setted weather data from weatherbit.io by using API key. Data is collected by "weatherScraping.py" and if there will be some problems during the process, they will be logged. The logged file is used in "failCorrector.py" for uncollected data.
